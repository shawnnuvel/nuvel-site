The dataset is frozen to an AS-OF date instead of hitting live scraping engines, so you get a stable baseline you can re-use across deals. Our outputs are directional IP and talent evidence you layer on top of your own diligence, not a legal registry.",
  footnote: "Patents publish with a lag of roughly 12–18 months after filing. Today's cut-off is a forensic snapshot of the public record through 2024-12-31."
